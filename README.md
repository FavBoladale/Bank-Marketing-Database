# Bank-Marketing-Database

### Personal loans are a lucrative revenue stream for banks. The typical interest rate of a two-year loan in the United Kingdom is around 10%. This might not sound like a lot, but in September 2022 alone UK consumers borrowed around £1.5 billion, which would mean approximately £300 million in interest generated by banks over two years!

You have been asked to work with a bank to clean and store the data they collected as part of a recent marketing campaign, which aimed to get customers to take out a personal loan. They plan to conduct more marketing campaigns going forward so would like you to set up a PostgreSQL database to store this campaign's data, designing the schema in a way that would allow data from future campaigns to be easily imported.

They have supplied you with a CSV file called "bank_marketing.csv", which you will need to clean, reformat, and split, in order to save separate files based on the tables you will create. It is recommended to use pandas for these tasks.

Lastly, you will write the SQL code that the bank can execute to create the tables and populate with the data from the csv files. As the banks are quite strict about their security, you'll save SQL files as multiline string variables that they can then use to create the database on their end.

You have been asked to design a database that will have three tables:

# Project Instructions
* Read in bank_marketing.csv as a pandas DataFrame.
* Split the data into three DataFrames using the information provided about the desired tables as your guide: one with information about the client, another containing campaign data, and a third to store information about economics at the time of the campaign.
* Rename the column "client_id" to "id" in the client (leave as-is in the other subsets); "duration" to "contact_duration", "previous" to "previous_campaign_contacts", "y" to "campaign_outcome", "poutcome" to "previous_outcome", and "campaign" to "number_contacts" in the campaign; and "euribor3m" to "euribor_three_months" and "nr_employed" to "number_employed" in economics.
* Clean the "education" column, changing "." to "_" and "unknown" to NumPy's null values.
* Remove periods from the "job" column.
* Convert "success" and "failure" in the "previous_outcome" and "campaign_outcome" columns to binary (1 or 0), along with changing "nonexistent" to NumPy's null values in "previous_outcome".
* Add a column called campaign_id in the campaign, where all rows have a value of 1.
* Create a DateTime column called last_contact_date, in the format of "year-month-day", where the year is 2022, and the month and day values are taken from the "month" and "day" columns.
* Remove any redundant data that might have been used to create new columns, ensuring the columns in each subset of the data match the table displayed in the notebook.
* Save the three DataFrames to CSV files without an index as client.csv, campaign.csv, and economics.csv respectively.
* Create a Python variable called client_table, containing SQL code as a multi-line string to create a table called client using values from client.csv.
* Create a Python variable called campaign_table, containing SQL code as a multi-line string to create a table called campaign using values from campaign.csv.
* Create a Python variable called economics_table, containing SQL code as a multi-line string to create a table called economics using values from economics.csv.
* In client, campaign, and economic, ensure the final line copies the data from their respective CSV files using the following template code snippet: \copy table_name from 'file_name.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER.
